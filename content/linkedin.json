    "Victoria S.<br />It is hard to beat the good fortune of having a manager like Jp. He is generous with his time, leads by example, and actively seeks ways to bring the best out of you. His talent and work ethic are eclipsed only by his care and humility. Jp is the kind of person who will go the extra mile for you, and at the same time, pave the way for you to walk your own path. He has been one of my greatest teachers, and I would recommend him without reservation. ",
    "Laura MacDonald, CPA<br />Jp is a renaissance man for the modern age! His problem solving and automation skills helped me find my way out of complex problems more than once. I loved working with him.",
    "Priscilla Yee, CPA, CA<br />I’ve had the pleasure of working with JP for a little over a year at LANDR. During that time, although we were not in the same department, I witnessed JP continuously go above and beyond the call of duty. He took on every challenge with a positive attitude and worked tirelessly to deliver every single time. In a very short time frame, he established himself as a key player within his department. Not only did he do his work extremely well, but he genuinely cared about the projects that he was involved in. <br />In my opinion, companies should be built with people like JP; individuals who have the skillset to do the work required, the passion to continuously strive for improvement, and the respect of their peers to foster teamwork and get results. I would not hesitate to recommend JP; any company would be lucky to have a person like him in the fold. ",
    "Sophie C.<br />To this day, I am still so impressed with JP's meticulous work ethic and observation skills. The devil is in the details, and JP will be the first one to point out the flaws and finding creative solutions to address them, from campaign creation to team management.<br />My transition into a Sales driven department was largely fast-track by JP's keenness in onboarding, as well as his eloquence and fluency in diverse skills touching UX, A/B testing, HTML/CSS, and so on.<br />I'm happily recommending him to any employers who are looking for a polyvalent and adaptable professional.",
    "Vanessa Salvo<br />JP joined LANDR at a time when our Customer Success team was going through a challenging transition phase. He faced the challenge relentlessly and proved himself time and time again as someone who cares a lot about his work. The effort he puts into things is mind-boggling. He goes the extra mile to solve a problem and has a positive, collaborative attitude. When you work with JP, it always feels like you're moving forward...and fast. It was a pleasure working with him and any organization would be lucky to have him. ",

With all of that said, I firmly believe Jp is a great addition to any team he is on, and I look forward to the day where our paths cross again!",
